        <h2>What is Dungeons & Dragons?</h2> 
        <p>Dungeons & Dragons, affectionately known as D&D or DND, is more than just a game; it's a gateway to boundless creativity and unforgettable storytelling. In D&D, players assume the roles of fantastical characters, from noble knights to cunning wizards, as they embark on quests set in richly imagined worlds.</p> <br>

        <h2>How is it Played?</h2>
        <p>At its core, D&D is a collaborative storytelling experience guided by rules and dice rolls. A Dungeon Master (DM) crafts the narrative and serves as the players' guide, while the players navigate challenges, make decisions, and roll dice to determine outcomes. The result? A dynamic adventure shaped by the choices of everyone involved.</p> <br>

        <h2>Exploring Terminology</h2>
        <p>To navigate the realms of D&D, it's essential to understand key terminology: 

            Character Sheet: A record of a player's character, detailing their abilities, skills, and backstory. 
            
            Campaign: A series of interconnected adventures forming a larger story arc. 
            
            NPC: Non-player characters controlled by the DM to interact with players. 
            
            Critical Hit: A lucky roll resulting in maximum damage. 
            
            Critical Fail: A disastrous roll with unforeseen consequences.  </p> <br>
